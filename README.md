## Features

- **tvOS home screen** — full-screen Top Shelf for the focused app, a glass dock, a 6-column grid, the three tvOS states (Top Shelf, grid with a frozen blurred background, full screen), springy focus motion and interface sounds.
- **Live Top Shelf** — what's trending right now on Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, CANAL+, Crunchyroll and other services, YouTube trends, Xbox Game Pass games, Steam top sellers, the next Ligue 1 and Champions League matches, Top albums for music apps, with film and series ratings. Other apps get an abstract tvOS-style wallpaper in their colours, never a plain logo.
- **Continue Watching** — for IPTV apps (AquaPlay, Hot Player) and Stremio: the last channel with its logo, or the film or series you were watching, with its title artwork, episode, time left and progress bar.
- **Official logos for 50+ apps**, and for any other app the launcher finds its official icon and an Apple TV background by itself.
- **Control Center** (tvOS 26/27 layout), even over a video — Sleep, Wi-Fi, Do Not Disturb, sleep timer, brightness, **audio output with Bluetooth headphones** (AirPods…, with battery), AirPlay and iPhone help, Sources, Settings.
- **Settings** — an Apple TV–style split view that covers every Samsung settings page, with real picture controls (backlight, contrast, sharpness, colour, local dimming).
- **Sources** — HDMI / USB-C / AirPlay as big tiles; pick the device on each input (Switch 2, Steam Deck, PS5, Xbox, PC, Mac, Apple TV…) and it shows its logo.
- **Remote buttons** — press Home twice for the app switcher, hold Home or press ⏯ for the Control Center. When they are installed, Samsung TV Plus opens AquaPlay and Prime Video opens TizenTube.
- **Alexa on the microphone button**, with a Siri-like glow at the bottom of the screen while you speak.
- **Hold OK on an app** — Edit Home Screen (move apps), Hide App, Delete App, exactly like tvOS.
- **Household profiles** next to the clock, with **Memoji** avatars — each person has their own home layout, hidden apps, preferences and recently opened apps.
- **Aerial screen saver** with Apple's real aerial videos, in 4K.
- **Keeps the screen fast** — apps left in the background for 10 minutes close by themselves (never the one you are watching).
- **Automatic updates** from this repository, with automatic rollback if a version fails to start.
- **Optimizer** — removes unused apps, silences ads, tracking and Bixby, blocks ad domains; fully reversible.
- **English and French** — the interface follows the screen's language, or *Settings › General & Privacy › Language*.
- **APL Launcher Setup** — one Windows app to install, optimize and restore everything.

Nothing else is installed: the installer puts APL Launcher and its small helper app, APL Overlay, on the screen, and that is all.

## Requirements

What works on which screen and remote: [docs/compatibility.md](docs/compatibility.md).

| | |
|---|---|
| **Screen** | A Samsung TV or Smart Monitor running Tizen (developed on a Smart Monitor M8, Tizen 9). |
| **Vetro** *(required)* | [Vetro](https://github.com/andrearicci93/vetro) must be installed and running on the screen, **before** you install APL Launcher. Vetro gives root access through a small service on the screen; APL Launcher uses it for the Home button and the other remote buttons, the Control Center over videos, real picture settings, Bluetooth audio, Alexa, closing unused apps and the optimizer. Install it with **Vetro's own guide**: it needs the screen to be rooted. Its dashboard then answers at `http://<screen-ip>:8099`. |
| **PC** | Windows 10 or 11 on the same network as the screen. |
| **Tizen Studio** | With the CLI and the *Samsung Certificate Extension* — [download](https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-studio/download). |
| **Samsung certificate** | An author + distributor certificate for your screen (Tizen Studio Certificate Manager, or one made with Apps2Samsung). APL Launcher Setup finds it. Keep it safe: every later install must be signed with the same certificate, or the screen refuses it. |

TizenBrew and TizenTube are **not** needed. If you use them, the launcher opens them and leaves them alone.

## Quick start

1. **Install Vetro** on the screen, following Vetro's guide, and check that `http://<screen-ip>:8099` opens on the PC.
2. **Download APL Launcher Setup** (`APL-Launcher-Setup.exe`) from the [latest release](https://github.com/Knikt/APL-Launcher-for-TizenOS/releases/latest) and open it. Windows may say the app is not signed: *More info › Run anyway*.
3. On the **Install** page, the app finds the screen (or type its IP address), checks Tizen Studio, the Samsung certificate on the PC, and takes the optional API keys (TMDB, YouTube, Fanart.tv) and websites to show as apps. Click **Install**: it builds, signs and installs the launcher and APL Overlay through Vetro, then opens the launcher.
4. Finish once, as the app shows you:
   - on the screen: *Settings › All Settings › Advanced Features* → **Autorun Smart Hub** off, **Autorun Last App** on;
   - in Vetro › **Remapper**: choose your remote in the device list (*Smart Control 2016* when it is paired over Bluetooth, *wt61p807 rc device* when it works by infrared only), map **Home** to **APL Launcher** and turn on **Remote interception**. Then click **Done — set up the buttons** in the app: it hands Home and ⏯ to APL Overlay, and Samsung TV Plus or Prime Video too when AquaPlay or TizenTube is installed.
5. *Optional:* the **Optimize** page removes unused apps and services. It reads the screen, shows the full list and waits for your confirmation.
6. *Optional:* for Alexa, open *Settings › Advanced Features › Alexa on the microphone button* in the launcher, choose Amazon Alexa and sign in with your Amazon account. The remote must be paired over Bluetooth: point it at the screen and hold **Back** and **⏯** together for 3 seconds. Then pick *Smart Control 2016* in Vetro's device list.

**Something wrong?** The **Restore** page gives the Home button back to Samsung and undoes the optimizer.

Full guide: [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md).

## Updates

The launcher **updates itself**. Every 6 hours it checks this repository, downloads the new version and restarts when you are on the home screen. If a new version fails to start, the screen goes back to the installed one on its own.

Open APL Launcher Setup again only when the screen asks for it, which happens when a new version needs new app permissions, and to update APL Overlay.

## APL Launcher Setup

One Windows app, in English, or in French when Windows is. Nothing to install to run it (it uses the .NET Framework built into Windows 10 and 11).

| Page | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Install** | Finds the screen, checks the PC, builds, signs and installs the launcher and APL Overlay, then guides you through the last two settings. |
| **Optimize** | Removes unused apps, silences ads, tracking and Bixby, blocks ad domains. Shows everything first; reversible. |
| **Restore** | Gives the Home button back to Samsung and undoes the optimizer; can also uninstall the launcher. |
| **Tools** | Preview the launcher on the PC with an on-screen remote, repair TizenBrew and TizenTube, read-only diagnostics of the inputs and of the screen, open Vetro. |

The app runs the PowerShell scripts in `scripts/`, which also work on their own. To build it yourself: [installer/README.md](installer/README.md).

## FAQ

**Can the launcher itself be in 4K?** No. On these screens the layer that draws apps and menus has a single 1920×1080 mode, Samsung's own menus included, and the panel scales it up. Video has its own 4K layer: the aerial screen saver and the video apps use it.

**Can it install Android apps (APK)?** No. Tizen cannot run Android apps, and root access does not change that. Look for the app in the Samsung App Store, or add its website as an app.

**Does the Top Shelf show my personal recommendations?** No. Netflix, Crunchyroll and similar services have no public API for account data. The launcher shows what is popular on each service in your country. *Continue Watching* cards exist only for apps that keep their history on the screen (AquaPlay, Hot Player, Stremio).

**Is it safe?** Nothing in Samsung's system is deleted. Samsung's home is only closed in the background, and **Restore** in APL Launcher Setup undoes everything.

**Does it affect TizenBrew or TizenTube?** No. The launcher only opens them, and the optimizer always keeps them and TizenBrew's service. Samsung's own YouTube app (`9Ur5IzDKqV.TizenYouTube`) is not TizenTube; the optimizer can uninstall it on request. Keep Developer Mode's *Host PC IP* at `127.0.0.1`: TizenBrew and Vetro need it. If they stop working, run **Repair TizenBrew** in APL Launcher Setup › Tools.

**Which language?** English, and French: the launcher is in French when the screen is, the installer when Windows is. *Settings › General & Privacy › Language* picks one. To add a language, copy `launcher/js/lang-fr.js` and translate it.
